API Route: calculate_results
=======================================================================================================================================
Method: POST
Purpose: Calculate pick outcomes based on fixture results for a round. Processes wins/losses, updates player lives, handles eliminations, and manages no-pick scenarios using bulk operations for optimal performance.
=======================================================================================================================================
Request Payload:
{
  "round_id": 123                      // integer, required - ID of round to calculate results for
}

Success Response:
{
  "return_code": "SUCCESS",
  "message": "Pick outcomes calculated successfully",
  "results": {
    "winners": 5,                      // integer, players with winning picks this round
    "losers": 3,                       // integer, players with losing picks this round  
    "draws": 0,                        // integer, players who picked draws (counted as losses)
    "processed": 10,                   // integer, total picks processed this round
    "playersEliminated": 2,            // integer, players eliminated (lives reduced to 0)
    "noPickProcessed": 2,              // integer, players who didn't pick (life deducted)
    "total": 10                        // integer, total players affected by calculation
  }
}

Error Response:
{
  "return_code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",   // or "ROUND_NOT_FOUND", "UNAUTHORIZED", "SERVER_ERROR"  
  "message": "Round ID is required and must be a number"
}
=======================================================================================================================================
Return Codes:
"SUCCESS"
"VALIDATION_ERROR"    - Invalid or missing round_id parameter
"ROUND_NOT_FOUND"     - Round with specified ID does not exist
"UNAUTHORIZED"        - User not authenticated or not competition organiser
"SERVER_ERROR"        - Database error or unexpected system failure
=======================================================================================================================================
Algorithm:
1. Validate round exists and user is organiser
2. BULK calculate all pick outcomes (WIN/LOSE) based on fixture results
3. BULK update player lives based on losses
4. Mark all processed fixtures as complete
5. If all fixtures complete: process no-pick players (deduct lives)
6. Insert audit trail and player progress records
7. Return comprehensive statistics
